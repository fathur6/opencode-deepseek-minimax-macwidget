# opencode-deepseek-minimax-macwidget

macOS menu bar app that tracks DeepSeek and MiniMax API usage in real time. Shows balance, credit, and token usage at a glance.

## Credits

- **minimax-usage-checker** by [AungMyoKyaw](https://github.com/AungMyoKyaw/minimax-usage-checker) — original inspiration and reference implementation
- **Lobe Icons** by [lobehub](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons) — DeepSeek and MiniMax brand icons

## Features

- Menu bar icons showing DeepSeek and MiniMax balances
- Auto-fetches from DeepSeek balance API and MiniMax credit API
- Manual credit entry with save/cancel
- 15-minute auto-refresh
- B&W monochrome design
- DeepSeek remaining history: a 168-hour view with up to 30 days of local hourly snapshots. Green bars are top-ups, gray bars are balance reductions, and left/right controls move both charts together by one day.
- Remaining Quota: a scrollable 168-hour view with up to 30 days of local hourly snapshots. Blue is the DeepSeek balance in USD (left axis); green is the OpenAI remaining percent (right axis, 0/50/100%).
- Durable 12-month ledger: every hourly quota snapshot is stored in a local SQLite database and survives app rebuilds and restarts. The Quota chart history is seeded from this ledger each refresh.
- Month-end report: on the last calendar day of each month, a summary plus the month's snapshot data is emailed and archived locally.

## Example

### DeepSeek + MiniMax

The original version keeps both providers visible in a compact menu-bar panel. Each card shows the provider balance and status at a glance, while the Refresh and Quit actions remain available below the cards.

### DeepSeek + MiniMax + ChatGPT Plus

The expanded version adds a ChatGPT Plus quota card below the DeepSeek and MiniMax balances. It shows the remaining subscription percentage and the next quota reset date in the same compact menu-bar panel.

### Latest Iteration: Usage + Remaining Quota Charts

The current widget adds two navigable charts below the balance cards.

The **Input usage** chart is a 168-hour smoothed input-token chart showing
OpenAI in green and DeepSeek in blue, with calendar dates and month labels on
the x-axis.

The **Quota** chart plots the DeepSeek balance in USD (blue, left axis) and
the OpenAI remaining percent (green, right axis) on a shared 168-hour window.
Local hourly snapshots are retained for up to 30 days, and the left/right
controls move both charts together by one day.

### v1.3.0: 5-Hour + Weekly OpenAI Quota

The OpenAI card now shows both subscription windows as separate rows — a
**5h** bar directly above the existing **Weekly** bar. Each row has its own
remaining percentage, monochrome usage bar with a server-anchored elapsed
marker, and reset time. The estimated weekly cost stays anchored to the
168-hour window.

Both windows come from the same authenticated `/backend-api/wham/usage`
request and are classified by their `limit_window_seconds` duration
(`18000` = 5h, `604800` = weekly), so a reversed or reordered payload cannot
mislabel them. If one window is missing or malformed, the other is still
shown, and a failed refresh keeps the last known value for each window
independently. The new 5-hour readings are stored additively in the existing
local SQLite ledger; old rows and the DeepSeek/OpenAI usage and cost history
are preserved.

See [docs/releases/v1.3.0.md](docs/releases/v1.3.0.md) for release notes.

## API Approach

### DeepSeek — `/user/balance`

```
GET https://api.deepseek.com/user/balance
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

Returns `balance_infos[].total_balance` as a USD string. This is a public, undocumented endpoint used by the DeepSeek web console. Works with any valid API key.

### MiniMax — `/account/query_balance`

```
GET https://platform.minimax.io/account/query_balance
Authorization: Bearer <api-key>
```

Returns `available_amount` as a USD string. This is the web console's internal balance API. Unlike the documented `/coding_plan/remains` (prompt counts), this returns actual dollar credit. Works with the same API key used for chat/completion.

Both endpoints were discovered by inspecting network requests from their respective web consoles. Neither is documented in official API references.

### Auth

API keys are read from OpenCode's auth config at `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`:

```json
{
  "deepseek": {"type": "api", "key": "sk-..."},
  "minimax": {"type": "api", "key": "sk-..."}
}
```

## Build

```bash
cd opencode-widget
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme OpencodeWidgetApp -configuration Debug build
```

Requires macOS 14+ and Xcode 16+.
